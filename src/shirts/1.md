desc_en: "Worn in Wales’ first and only appearance at the FIFA World Cup Finals in 1958. The shirt worn in the tournament was the recently introduced Umbro “continental” short sleeve v-neck design and design-wise, this lighter cotton knit shirt stood the test of time. Rarely seen in its full splendour as the only footage of the tournament is in grainy black-and-white."
